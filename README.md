### Create and Assign Chores
Users can create new chores and assign them to either themselves or someone else in the family.

### Edit Chores
A chore can be edited by updating the deadline, changing the name, adding notes, or updating which user is assigned to this chore.

### Set Deadlines
A chore can be assigned a deadline to keep everyone on track. Did you wash those socks yet?
